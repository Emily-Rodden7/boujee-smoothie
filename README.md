## User Experience UX

### User Stories 

#### First time visiting the site

1. People visiting the site for the first time, I want people to be able to easily navigate around the site.
2. People leaving the site with more information about smoothies.
3. Give people an option to get in touch, to encougage engagment for them to keep coming back.

#### People returning to the site

1. I would want to keep updating the site, with more images, maybe even feature other peoples smoothies.
2. Being able to get in contact with people that have filled out the contact form to bring them back to the site. 

#### End goals of the site

1. For people to keep checking in with the site, to see if more images have been uploaded.
2. The end goal would be to make changes from just images and include the recipes that would go alongside them. Then give people an opportunity to upload/share their own smoothie recipes and the benefits they've found from drinking it.

### Design

- Make sure website works on mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop. Make sure images and text change depending on the screen size the user is looking from.
- Easy clear message from the home page.

After researching and brainstorming different names for my company/website; which I settled on calling it 'Boujuee Smoothie'. With a tagline of Juicy, Fresh, Irresistible.

Boujee is a slang term that means someone who is upwardly mobile and has a luxurious lifestyle but humble character. I got this definition from [online.](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/boujee/)

#### Research

See below example sites that I viewed to get ideas for my own Smoothie site. These are why I went with the colour scheme I did. I wanted to attract similar user that use the site below.

- [Love Struck Smoothies](https://love-struck.com/)
- [Fuel Juice Bar](https://fueljuicebars.com/)
- [Boost Juice](https://www.boostjuicebars.co.uk/drinks/)

#### Colour Scheme

- Main colour scheme used is [#008180](https://www.colorhexa.com/008180) for Logo font and [#f6d7b0](https://www.colorhexa.com/f6d7b0) for background colour.
- Text is going to be black to make it clear and stand out from the white and sandy backgrounds. 


#### Font Types

- Heading font type used is: [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?preview.text=Boujee%20Smoothie) from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Body font type used is: [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans?preview.text=Boujee%20Smoothie) from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The backup font I am using incase either of the above two don't work or breaks is the default: sans-serif.

#### Imagery

- Main home page image is bold, bright and full of colour to attact users to stay on the site and explore the other pages.
- Images used on the gallery page are appealing to attract users to want to drink smoothies.

#### Project Goals

My goal is the mention some of the different benefits you can get from drinking smoothies and showing different types of smoothies; over a 3 page website.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. There was one warning for the incorrect ALT attribute, so I changed this and run the test again, and the site passed. See my results below.

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Femily-rodden7.github.io%2Fboujee-smoothie%2F)

### Bugs

-   On mobile devices the Fruit & Veg Image on the home page wasn't sitting where it should. After a couple of reformatting, I prefered the mobile version without the Fruit & Veg Image. This image now only appears on screens larger than a standard mobile size screen. 

## Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on different devices including, Desktop, Laptop, iPhoneSE and Samsung Galaxy A51/71.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   My dad and partner were asked to review the site and feedback any problems they amy come across. As well as how easy the site is to navigate around. Due to the age difference between my dad and partner, I found out my website was easy to navigate for both generations.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

Boujee Smoothie was deployed to GitHub Pages.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. On the settings page, scroll down until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will then automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site. [Click here to see the live site.](https://emily-rodden7.github.io/boujee-smoothie/index.html)

## Next Stage

After launching this first version fo the site; I would like to continue to work on it to improve and add more features to give more reasons for people to keep coming back to the site. These include:

- Adding in recipes for each picture; as well as nutritional value and the benefits you could gain from drinking particular smoothies.
- Eventually have a newsletter featuring people's own versions of differnet smoothies and how the came to perfecting it. 
- Listing and exploring more benfits of smoothies and splitting different smoothies into different sections, depending on different benefits the user could gain.
